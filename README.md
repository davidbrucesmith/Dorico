Dorico is a new (first release 2016) music notation application that I am transferring to because Finale has finally finished its long life (I started using in the mid 80's, so that is forty years).  Finale indicates it will no longer support the software, and there is a cutoff of Sonoma (Mac OsX 14).  

This repository is intended to store files and workaround documents as the conversion process continues.  

Have not listened but this is [Creating an Opera Score in Dorico](https://youtu.be/vuumCtgdYmo) a youtube video.
